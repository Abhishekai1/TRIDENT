# TRIDENT: A Unified AI Safety Pipeline Against Echo Chambers, Phishing, and Surveillance Risks

**TRIDENT** (Tri-Domain Defense Stack) is a research-grade AI safety system that addresses three major risks highlighted by Geoffrey Hinton in his Nobel Prize speech:

1. **Echo Chambers** ‚Üí Breaks algorithmic filter bubbles using *diversity-constrained reranking* with calibrated exposure control.
2. **Phishing & Scams** ‚Üí Detects high-risk phishing messages with *Differential Privacy*-trained models and *Conformal Prediction* abstention for uncertain cases.
3. **Mass Surveillance Risks** ‚Üí Enables population-level exposure audits with *Local Differential Privacy* so platforms can monitor without collecting individual browsing histories.

This project combines **Recommender System Diversification**, **Differential Privacy (DP-SGD)**, **Conformal Prediction**, and **Explainable AI (XAI)** into a single end-to-end pipeline.

## **Key Features**

### üîç Echo Auditor & Diversity-Constrained Reranker
- Uses **UMAP + KMeans** clustering of news embeddings for topic identification.
- **xQuAD-inspired reranker** balances *relevance* and *topic coverage*.
- Measures *Intra-List Diversity (ILD)*, *KL divergence to global distribution*, and *click-proxy NDCG*.
- Visuals: UMAP topic maps, exposure distribution shifts, diversity‚Äìrelevance trade-off curves.

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy-Preserving Phishing Detection
- Trains a **phishing/spam detector** with **Opacus** (DP-SGD) for user data protection.
- Wraps the model with **Split-Conformal Prediction** to abstain when uncertain.
- Outputs: ROC-AUC, PR curves, reliability diagrams, abstention‚Äìrisk trade-offs.
- Uses **SHAP Permutation Explainer** for embedding-level feature attributions.

### üìä Privacy-Respecting Exposure Audits
- Implements **Randomized Response (Local DP)** for estimating population-level exposure diversity without raw logs.
- Plots *privacy budget (Œµ)* vs *L1 estimation error*.
- Demonstrates true vs estimated distributions.

## üöÄ Research Impact & Future Directions

TRIDENT is not just a prototype ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **blueprint for next-generation AI safety systems** that integrate bias mitigation, privacy-preserving ML, and trustworthy decision-making into a single, auditable framework.

### Why this work matters:
- **Bridging silos in AI safety**: Most research tackles *bias*, *privacy*, or *robustness* in isolation. TRIDENT unifies them, enabling *holistic safety evaluations* on real-world data.
- **Operationally ready**: The design is compatible with existing recommender pipelines, security gateways, and privacy audit systems, making deployment feasible in high-impact environments.
- **Policy relevance**: Outputs can directly inform regulators and governance bodies by providing *quantifiable, tunable metrics* (diversity scores, abstention rates, privacy‚Äìaccuracy curves) instead of opaque ‚ÄúAI says so‚Äù outcomes.
- **Societal benefit**: 
  - Reduces algorithmic echo-chamber effects that fuel polarization.
  - Blocks phishing attempts without storing sensitive personal data.
  - Empowers oversight without enabling surveillance.

### Immediate research opportunities:
- **Fairness‚ÄìRelevance Optimization**: Extending the reranker to optimize multiple fairness objectives (e.g., demographic parity, exposure fairness) jointly with click-through metrics.
- **Adaptive Privacy Budgets**: Dynamically adjusting Œµ in Local DP telemetry based on detected drift or regulatory thresholds.
- **Domain Transfer**: Applying TRIDENT to other domains ‚Äî e.g., health misinformation feeds, fraud detection in fintech, or personalized education systems.
- **Causal Robustness**: Integrating Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) into the reranker‚Äôs click model to improve out-of-distribution stability.
- **Open Benchmarking**: Establishing a public leaderboard for **safety‚Äìutility trade-offs** where researchers can compare new mitigation strategies against TRIDENT baselines.

### Long-term vision:
The ultimate goal is to make safety layers like TRIDENT a **default requirement** in AI deployment pipelines ‚Äî just as encryption is now standard in network protocols.  
By making the architecture open-source and reproducible, we invite **academics, industry engineers, and policymakers** to iterate, extend, and deploy this stack in contexts where algorithmic harms can have large-scale societal consequences.
